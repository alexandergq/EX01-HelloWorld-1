##Exercise: HelloWorld (8 Points)


* **Note** that all assignments must be able to run in the lab. If you do your assignment from home then it must run as if it was done in the lab. Assignments that are not compatible recieve no credit and you will not be allowed to resubmit. Please test your code in the lab before submitting it. *

The project name of this exercise is **HelloWorld**.

This is your first assignment and this assignment's purpose is to give you some practice using the tools that we will be involved with all semester. This exercise should help you adapt to the class' workflow.

The **first thing you should do** is read the moodle web page titled "How to Start Every Project in this Class". You can find this page by looking on the class moodle page. It should be in the first block.

After you have read that page follow the instructions. The **ProjectName** mentioned on the page is called **HelloWorld** for this assignment. All assignments start with a sentence giving you the name of the project. You can see this above in the yellow highlighted word.

Once you have followed the instructions shown on the "How to Start Every Project in this Class" web page you should have a file called **Main.java**. Replace all of the code present in that file with the code shown below.

  
```java
package edu.sbcc.cs105;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World");

	}
}
```  

You can simply copy the code from the grey box and paste it into the **Main.java** file. Save it. Now run the file by choosing **Run -> Run** in Eclipse. This notation means to go to the Eclipse **Run** menu and selct the item called **Run**. You should see an output that says "Hello, World".

Once you've completed this you can go on and answer the following questions. Copy the questions from the block below into the space provided **in moodle** and then fill in your answers after the questions. **Please don't just put the answers!**

1. What is the name of the source file that you wrote?


2. What version of Java are we using? (Hint: Look after the item called JRE System Library)

###How to turn in this exercise

There is one file to be submitted for this exercise and questions to be answered:

1. There will be a question block below which should have the questions (shown above) pasted into it and your answers following each question.

2. The exercise must be exported as a **ZIP** file from Eclipse and uploaded below. You can find instructions on how to export your project from Eclipse by looking at the [2.0 Exporting Resources from Eclipse](http://realsearchgroup.org/SEMaterials/tutorials/import_export/index.html#section2_0) tutorial written up by the [Realsearch](http://www.realsearchgroup.org/realsearch/) group.
